## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software automation for a family member who cannot hire a full time asstant but needs adminstrative support.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything. I haven't done any coding in years.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Lifelong curiosity and intractable ADHD means I'm a jack of all trades but master of none. I've retired early due to health issues, so I'm looking to expand my horizons and my skillset.
